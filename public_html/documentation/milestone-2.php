		<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>My site will be one page and have the following sections:</p>
		<p><strong>Welcome:</strong> When the site opens at the top of the page will be a picture and the page name printed on top. As well as a brief description of what kind of a blog it is.</p>
		<p><strong>Menu:</strong> There will be a menu that when selected overlays the page content. It will include links to other social media
		accounts held by the blogger. It will also include a page jump link to the "contact me" form at the bottom of the page. The menu bar will be positioned under the site's main
		graphic but when the page is scrolled the menu bar will pin to the top of the display, making it accessible anywhere.</p>
		<p><strong>Content:</strong> This blog's posts will be organized in a single column ordered from most recent at the top. Most blog posts will not have any functionality aside from
		photo posts will display full resolution versions of the photos when clicked. Users are expected to merely view this blog and not concern themselves with liking, commenting on, or editing.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact Me:</strong> At the end of the web page will be a form named "Contact Me". It will not contain personal information about the blogger. It will mainly
		be used for end users to leave private messages for the blogger.</p>
		<h2>Wire Frames</h2>
