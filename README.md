A Blog for Karson. <br>
This project will be used to showcase my skills as a developer and as a fully 
functional personal website for my girlfriend.
## PWP Feedback 
### Milestone1
#### Feedback
Good job on Milestone1 you have met all the project specifications and your HTML is error free. https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~tsmith179/karsons-blog/public_html/documentation/milestone-1.php. In the persona, I do want you to list the operating system. Remember that the technology section helps define what restrictions we have to follow when choosing the stack/libraries for the project. (for example if we are targetting end users who can only use Windows7 we have to make sure any tech used is compatible with Internet Explorer). 
#### Suggestions/Concerns
I am little concerned what you outlined for PWP is out of scope for the project. From what I can tell from you plan on using a CMS like Wordpress for your PWP. Using a CMS is beyond the scope of the project. With the amount of content, you outlined it is incredibly important that you have a clear content strategy. I challenge you to think how your end user interacts with the content, where the content is hosted and how you plan on creating/maintaining it.

### Milestone 2a Feedback
Good work on the wireframes and the content strategy. You seem to have a clear & concise idea of how you want to create your PWP. This will provide you the foundation of moving forward into the development phase.

For displaying your photos when clicked, I would suggest checking out something like FancyBox3. I have provided a link to the JavaScript library that will help you create this animation.  https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/

Additional Recommendations for you:

Google Fonts - has ~1000 free fonts & easy to integrate https://fonts.google.com/
Bootstrap documentation should be able to provide you with a way of managing your navbar functionality.
FontAwesome - quality library with free iconography for use.

If you're feel taking a reading ahead regarding the contact form integration, here is the documentation:

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
