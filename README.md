A Blog for Karson. <br>
This project will be used to showcase my skills as a developer and as a fully 
functional personal website for my girlfriend.
## PWP Feedback 
### Milestone1
#### Feedback
Good job on Milestone1 you have met all the project specifications and your HTML is error free. https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~tsmith179/karsons-blog/public_html/documentation/milestone-1.php. In the persona, I do want you to list the operating system. Remember that the technology section helps define what restrictions we have to follow when choosing the stack/libraries for the project. (for example if we are targetting end users who can only use Windows7 we have to make sure any tech used is compatible with Internet Explorer). 
#### Suggestions/Concerns
I am little concerned what you outlined for PWP is out of scope for the project. From what I can tell from you plan on using a CMS like Wordpress for your PWP. Using a CMS is beyond the scope of the project. With the amount of content, you outlined it is incredibly important that you have a clear content strategy. I challenge you to think how your end user interacts with the content, where the content is hosted and how you plan on creating/maintaining it.
